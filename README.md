*Not code btw - just putting this here for fun*

Wearable Sensor: This rendering is part of the work I did for Bandodkar Research Group at NC State University - the abstract of the project is below. In short, this rendering depicts a biosensor which is to be wrapped around some chronic wound on a person's skin. It has various sensors contained on the brass electrodes, which are very thin as to be flexible and not warp/stretch as skin bends.

Abstract:
Chronic wounds stop skin cells from regenerating and can lead to complications such as infections. Currently, wounds can be manually monitored by removing cloth that covers them, or by the use of amperometric sensors. However, data collected from cloth will degrade soon after it is in the environment of the wound. Amperometric sensors are able to collect data in real time, but are bulky due to the batteries that they require, so they are not suitable for use in wearable devices. The purpose of this research is to study the development of wireless battery-free wearables that use a biofuel cell system to monitor lactate levels in wounds. Monitoring lactate levels will help determine the progression and healing rate of the wound, as wounds in different developmental stages will have different levels of lactate present. The amount of lactate is measured through the use of a biofuel cell system, which uses lactate to generate electrical signals. In turn, the magnitude of the electrical signals are linearly proportional to the concentration of lactate. 3D software such as AutoCAD is used to create several stencils which are part of the screen printing process. With the stencils, features on the circuit board will be printed. After these sensors are printed, they are tested and improvements are made, as necessary.

Hextech Key: This is a rendering of a key from the game League of Legends. I thought it would be a pretty object to render, and I like the small engravings on the body of the key. I couldn't find a great material for the holographic pane on the loop of the key, so I just used tinted glass - it's not perfect, but it looks decent.
